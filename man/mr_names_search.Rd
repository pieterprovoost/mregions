\usage{
mr_names_search(x, q = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, q}{Either a \code{tbl_df}, returned from \code{\link[=mr_names]{mr_names()}}, or
a query as a character string. If a \code{tbl_df}, you must pass a query
string to \code{q}. If a query string (character) is passed to \code{x},
leave \code{q} as \code{NULL}}

\item{...}{Parameters passed on to \code{\link[=agrep]{agrep()}}}
}
\value{
\code{NULL} if no matches found, or a data.frame, or tibble, of class
\code{tbl_df}, with slots:
\itemize{
\item name (character) - name of the region, which is a combination of the
name_first and name_second, e.g., Morocco:elevation_10m
\item title (character) - title for the region

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get region names with mr_names() function
(res <- mr_names("MarineRegions:eez"))

# to save time, pass in the result from mr_names()
mr_names_search(res, q = "Amer")

# if you don't pass in the result from mr_names(), we have to
# call mr_names() internally, adding some time
mr_names_search(x = "iho", q = "Black")
mr_names_search(x = "iho", q = "Sea")

# more examples
mr_names_search("iho", "Sea")
(res <- mr_names("MarineRegions:iho"))
mr_names_search(res, q = "Sea")
